-- Loads DCS's Database module, allowing cross-referencing checks and unit technical
-- data to be imported from DCS fresh, not from packaged values.
-- NOTE: Requires sanitization of 'require' in MissionScripting to be commented out,
--       i.e. comment out line "require = nil" in <DCS[.openbeta]>/Scripts/MissionScripting.lua

-- Loads DCS's JSON module, allowing efficient saving of data to and from files.
-- NOTE: Requires sanitization of 'require' and 'io' in MissionScripting to be commented out,
--       i.e. comment out lines "require = nil" and "sanitizeModule('io')" in
--            <DCS[.openbeta]>/Scripts/MissionScripting.lua
-- WARNING: Disabling this will make it so the server cannot save nor load from save file!
--          This means server resets will start over from the beginning of the campaign.

-- What year (up to and including) of equipment the server should allow usage of.
-- Also used to determine what the initial start year should be on map reset, what
-- era of weapons should be set, what regiments and forces are available, etc.
-- Some notable years include:
--   Russo-Georgian War: 2008
--   Iraq War (Iraqi Freedom): 2003-2011
--   "Behind Enemy Lines"(tm): 1995
--   Bosnian War: 1992-1995
--   Georgian Civil War: 1991-1993
--   Gulf War (Desert Storm): 1991
--   Gulf War (Desert Shield): 1990-1991
--   "Top Gun"(tm): 1986
--   "Red Dawn"(tm): 1984
--   "Firefox"(tm): 1982
--   Sovietâ€“Afghan War: 1979-1989
--   Vietnam War: 1955-1975 (US: 1964-1973)
--   Korean War: 1950-1953
--   Cold War: 1947-1991
--   Normandy Invasion: 1945

-- number, such as -8 for US-PST, 4 for Georgian-ST, etc., or may use "FromMap" to load

-- How many full-on night sequences should be created, for every passed game-day.

-- Upper capacity of moving units that are allowed at once. A higher value means more
-- units can move, which provides a more engaging simulation, but can severly lag DCS
-- servers (a seemingly common gripe of DCS server administrators).
-- NOTE: This is not a strict maximum, but more like a throttling value that attempts
--       to be honored as the game progresses.

# FDMM_DCS
Fully Dynamic Multiplayer Mission for DCS.

** CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT **

FDMM aims to create a fully dynamic multiplayer mission system for the DCS: World combat flight simulator.

FDMM will feature:

- A raging ground and sea war with units that move, attack, defend, and can capture towns/airports, which is heavily influenced by player actions through on-the-fly automated mission tasking and player-based forward air controllers.
- Persistent map contents between server resets - a single playthrough can take weeks to determine a real overall winner.
- AI that scales conflict zones based on number of players active - war slows down during off-hours when only a few players are around, and speeds up during on-hours when more players are active.
- No more infinite spawn - actual sea, air, land, and railway convoys that must be protected in order for planes, ammunition, equipment, and fuel to be delivered in order to supply airports, carriers, etc.
- A command token system that gives players rewards for completing missions related to the overall war that can be used to purchase force-enhancing units and AI-assisted specialty missions.
- Random side missions including fighting off insurgents, pirates, rescuing POWs, etc.
- Specialty missions for helicopters including search and rescue, resupply, base building, mechanized infantry transport, and the new ASW sub-hunting and ship rescue.
- PvP and PvE support.

** Currently under development, please check back later for updates. **

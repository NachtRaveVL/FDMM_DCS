FDMM aims to create a fully dynamic multiplayer mission system for the DCS: World combat flight simulator.

FDMM is visualized as including (and granted some of these items may turn out to not be as easy to accomplish as we necessarily hope):
- A raging Red vs. Blue ground & sea war with AI-enhanced units that move, attack, defend, and patrol intelligently, units of which can encircle and capture enemy battle groups, capture territory and take control of assets inside such, assault & defend high valued assets, set up defensive perimeters (/w active patrols), etc. - all of which is heavily influenced by player actions through on-the-fly automated mission tasking and even player-based battlegroup AFAC.
- Actually useful JTAC/AWACS that operates on the basis of engaging players with missions based on their desired aircraft and play-style - players get to pick whatever mission style they want to participate in (if not wanting to be automatically assigned to one based on combat sitation), and the AI automatically attempts to create the combat situation if necessary for such a mission to have relevance.
- AI automatically scales conflict zones based on number of players active - war slows down during off-hours when only a few players are around (or goes into total cease-fire mode when no players are active), and speeds up during on-hours when more players are active.
- Persistent map between server resets - a single full playthrough can take any length of time to determine the overall winner.
- Semi-realistic combat formations, unit naming, and force compositions based on real-life nation-specific OoB.
- No more infinite spawn or infinite resources - land, sea, air, and railway convoys spawn in at key map-edge locations that must be protected as they move to their intended drop-off locations in order for planes, ammunition, equipment, and fuel to be utilized by players.
- Downed pilots who get downed in enemy territory must escape said territory or be taken prisoner by enemy units, which in the case they are captured results in player location give-aways to the enemy.
- A command token reward system that gives players spendable tokens for completing missions related to the overall war effort that can be used to purchase support units (such as convoy escorts and target-lasing predator drones), combat actions (such as damaged unit repair and force replenishment), AI-assisted specialty missions (such as long range bomber strike attempts), and player-based battlegroup AFAC takeover.
- Battlefield contains per-team command centers, air operation centers, repair centers, drone control stations, communication towers, etc. that have a real effect on what players can and can't do (for example, a team that loses their drone control station cannot request a drone fly-over to lase ground targets with).
- Repeatable base missions, such as air patrols, reconnaissance missions, etc. that allows for players to always have something to do and be rewarded for it.
- Random side missions that occur over time including fighting off rogue nation insurgents, high-seas pirates, rescuing of POWs, etc. that gives players extra rewards for completing.
- Specialty missions for helicopters including search and rescue, resupply, base building, infantry air assualt, ground & ship-borne evac & rescue, and sub-hunting ASW missions including sonar buoy drops and sonar cable dips.
- Realistic weather that uses real-life weather reporting for determining in-game weather conditions, including an actual night mode for players who play late at night.
- Custom radio repeater stations, including reports containing wind direction & speed, ground barometric pressure, etc.

Additionally, FDMM will allow:
- Configurable server scripts that allows server admins to customize their server, set MOTD, set radio channels, and setup how the AI plays.
- Configurable year/time-era & production limiters to control what kinds of units are allowed to spawn (with reasonable fallbacks in case a particular unit type is not yet available in DCS).
- Configurable auto-kick and auto-warn scripts that automatically punishes players who don't fly safe.
- Friendly fire -punish and -forgive mechanics to allow players a choice in how to handle FF incidents.
- PvP and PvE support, with configurable AI difficulty, aggressiveness, etc.

Other systems that FDDM is due to support:
- AIRBOSS (for carrier ATC)
- Civilian Air Traffic (with some modification)
- Automated JTAC Lasing (for drones)
- (more to come soon)
